# WGS84-to-PRS92-PTM
This is a coordinate converter from WGS84 to Philippine Transverse Mercator in PRS92 datum using pyproj.

The code involves datum transformation from WGS84 to PRS92, then reproject the PRS92 geographic coordinates to Philippine Transverse Mercator. 

Please note that this is a work in progress. I will continue to refactor this while I'm still learning how to code.
